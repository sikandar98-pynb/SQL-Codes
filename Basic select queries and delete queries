// After Inserting values in the Employee table and the Salary Table, the user wishes to select the values
SELECT * FROM Employee // This would provide the user with all the values inserted in the table.
//Similarly
SELECT * FROM Salary // This would provide the user with all the values inserted in the table.
---
// If the user wishes to delete a particular record from the table, following is the query:

DELECT FROM Employee
  WHERE Employee_ID = 7       // This would delete all the records in the Employee Table where the Employee_ID is equal to 7.
